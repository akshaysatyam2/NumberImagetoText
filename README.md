# Number Recognition Project

## Overview
This project aims to recognize handwritten numbers using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of numbers written in words, and it predicts the corresponding numeric values.

## Features
- **Training Data:** The model is trained on a diverse dataset of handwritten numbers in words (e.g., "one," "two," etc.) and their corresponding numeric values from *mnist*.

- **Model Architecture:** The machine-learning model is implemented using TensorFlow with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification.

- **User Interface:** The project includes a simple user interface where users can upload an image containing a number in words, and the model predicts its numeric value.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
